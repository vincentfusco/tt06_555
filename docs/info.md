## How it works

It duplicates the functionality of a 555 timer. Try configuring it in the "astable" configuration using external resistors and capacitors.

## How to test

Find a 555 timer datasheet and attempt some of the suggested circuits. 

Connect pins to a breadboard with jumper wire. 

Construct circuit shown in Figure 7-5 at: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lmc555.pdf?ts=1711738020668.

Test 2:

Duplicate circuit in Figure 6-2 at: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lmc555.pdf?ts=1711738020668. Compare resulting maximum frequency. The CMOS-based TI 555-Timer has a maximum frequency of 3.0MHz. Compare.

## External hardware

1. Wires for breadboard.
2. Through-hole resistors and capacitors of various values, LEDs, etc.
3. Breadboard.
4. Oscilloscope (for maximum frequency test)
